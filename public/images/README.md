- **Quality**: High quality screenshots that showcase the dashboard clearly

## Fallback Behavior

If an image is missing, the landing page will display a placeholder with an icon and message indicating which image needs to be added. This ensures the page remains functional even without all images.

## How to Add Images

1. Take screenshots of your dashboard pages
2. Optimize them for web (compress if needed)
3. Save them with the exact filenames listed above
4. Place them in `/public/images/` directory
5. The images will automatically appear on the landing page
